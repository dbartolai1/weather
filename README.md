#  Weather App
- Making an iOS weateher app to learn how to work with frameworks and more complex navigation in UIKit
- Disclaimer: This is from an iOS Academy tutorial on YouTube

## First Commit (Part 1)
- Set up documents for the different managers (Weather, Settings, and Tab Bar)
- Set up folders to keep organized (Managers, Controllers, Models, ViewModels, Views, and Other)
- Set up the tab bar navigation in the Tab View Controller to navigate between the weather page and settings page

## Second Commit (Part 2)
- Added logic to LocationManager to pull users location
- Set up prompt to the user for location access
- Attach the Weather and Settings views to their respective tabs
- Currently, the coordinates of user are printed to the console when the app is run

## Third Commit (Part 3)
- Set up a table in the Settings View
- Set up an enum with cases for each setting in the View Model
- Table reads the enum to display each setting
- All of that is perpetuated in the view controller
- Attempted to fetch weather from weather manager, but reaching some issues in that regard
